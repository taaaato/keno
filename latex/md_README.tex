This application allows the user to play the game Keno.

\begin{quote}
{\itshape Keno is a lottery-\/like gambling game often played at modern casinos, and also offered as a game by some state lotteries.} \end{quote}
{\itshape Players wager by choosing numbers ranging from 1 through (usually) 80. After all players make their wagers, 20 numbers (some variants draw fewer numbers) are drawn at random, either with a ball machine similar to ones used for lotteries and bingo, or with a random number generator.}

The user must initialize the application with a parameter informing the location of a file with this information\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item His initial balance/credit;
\item How many rounds he wishes to play;
\item The number(s) in that he want to bet.
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md3}{}\doxysection{File example\+:}\label{md_README_autotoc_md3}

\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{1500.0}

\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{>> g++ keno.cpp aux.cpp}
\DoxyCodeLine{>> ./a.out file.dat}
\end{DoxyCode}


The application will then generate random winner numbers and inform if the player won and how much in each round. At the end of the rounds the general result (credits spent and final balance) is informed in a summary.\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md5}{}\doxysection{$\sim$ Work to be done $\sim$}\label{md_README_autotoc_md5}
There\textquotesingle{}s yet several points where this project can be improved. Namely\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Improve the classes. At the moment they are not as specified on the assignment, more like a functional but very basic version.
\item Separate more functions from the main function.
\item Make more checks to prevent possible errors.
\item Document better.
\end{DoxyItemize}
